#Lab9

This repository is Stacy Chang's lab9 repository from Fall 2016 Stat 159 class. In this lab, we learned how to use LaTex to write document. This repository includes this README markdown file, report.Rnw (written in Latex), and PDF file for the report. Another directory is the images which includes the scatterplot that was used in the report.
